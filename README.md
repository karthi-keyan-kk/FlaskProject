# FlaskProject
In this, we can add, delete, update the employee details in database using web application. I used Flask framework to create this web application and connect with my database for that I used pymsql library. 

# Flask Library
Flask is a web framework. This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be some web pages, a blog, a wiki or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a commercial website. Advantages of using Flask framework are: There is a built-in development server and a fast debugger provided. Lightweight.

# Templates
If your website contains only few pages, changing its style will take you some time but is doable. However, if you have a lot of pages (for example the list of items you sell in your store), this task become overwhelming. Using templates you are able to set a basic layout for your pages and mention which element will change. This way you can define your header once and keep it consistent over all the pages of your website, and if you need to change your header, you will only have to update it in one place. Using a template engine will save you a lot of time when creating your application but also when updating and maintaining it.\kajcbkasjcbaskjbaskjcbas
